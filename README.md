# Masked_person_head_pose_estimation

This is on goint project ( to estimate masked_person_head_pose) !

My goal is making my model's accuracy as well as other state of art head pose model's accuracy in occluded face.

This code is made by Pytorch and i referenced Hopenet ( https://github.com/natanielruiz/deep-head-pose ).

Thank you.
